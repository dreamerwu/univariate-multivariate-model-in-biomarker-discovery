1. linear regression vs logistic regression vs Cox regression model:
linear regression for continuous outcomes, logistic regression for binary outcomes, and Cox regression for time-to-event outcomes.
1) a linear regression model is used to evaluate whether specific covariates are associated with continuous outcome. For such model, the effect size
   of each covariate is simply the estimated coefficient, i.e. the b terms;
2) a logistic regression model is used to evaluate whether specific covariates are associated wtih a binary outcome (0 or 1) that has no longitudinal aspect.
   The effect size of each covariate is typically provided as an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
   
   

2. Univariable/multivariable univariate/multivariate regression model:
variate means outcome, variable indicates exploratory factor;
1) Univariate univariable regression model: a model with one outcome and one explanatory variable;
2) Univariate multivariable regression model: a model with one outcome and several explanatory variables;
3) Multivariate univariable regression model: a model with multiple outcomes and single explanatory variable;
4) Multivariate multivariable regression model: a model with multiple outcomes and multiple explanatory variables;

Univariate multivariable regression model: linear regression, logistic regression, Cox proportional hazards regression



univariable : one dependent variable (outcome variable, such as survival/response) and one independent variable 
multivariable: one dependent variable (outcome variable) and multiple 



Multivariable logistic and linear regression models for identifying clinical relevant biomarkers
Question1: when to use mutivariable logistic regression model? when to use multivariable linear regression model?


Odd ratio (OR) and 95% CI must always be reported in regression analysis if you are doing logistic regression.

Odd ratio will tell you the size of effect, and the p value will tell you the probability that your result is due to chance.
